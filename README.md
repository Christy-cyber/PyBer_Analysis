# PyBer Ride Share Analysis
## Overview and Metrics
Data from 2019 were analyzed for PyBer, a ride sharing company, in order to develop recommendations regarding access to ride share services for each city type (urban, suburban, and rural) and affordability of ride share services for underserved neighborhoods.  The following metrics were requested:
  - average fare cost by total rides per city, highlighting city type
  - number of riders per city type 
  - amount of fare cost per city type
  - number of drivers per city type 
  - percentage of total fares per city type 
  - percentage of rides per city type 
  - percentage of drivers per city type 
  - weekly total fares from January through April 2019 per city type   


## Resources
- Data Sources: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software and Programming Languages: Jupyter Notebook v. 6.4.6; Python v. 3.8.3 :: Anaconda, Inc.; conda v. 4.11.0

## Results
  - **Average fare cost by total rides per city, highlighting city type and number of drivers per city:**  There is an inverse relationship between number of rides and average fare cost.  Urban cities have the greatest number of rides but have the lowest fares when compared to rural cities that have the fewest rides with the highest fares.  Fare cost and number of rides for suburban cities fall between the other two city types.  Additionally, the greatest number of drivers are found in urban areas, followed by suburban and then rural cities (Fig. 1).

  - **Number of rides per city type:**  Urban cities had the highest number of median rides at 24.  This was followed by 17 rides in suburban cities and 6 rides in rural cities.  A single city, West Angela, has the highest ride count of 39 (Fig. 2)

  - **Fare cost per city type:**  Urban cities had the lowest median fare cost that approximated $25.00 per fare.  This was followed by ~$31.00 fares in suburban cities and ~$37.00 fares in rural areas (Fig. 3).

  - **Number of drivers per city type:**  Urban cities had the highest number of drivers (37), followed by suburban cities (16), and rural cities (4).  There is a higher spread in the number of drivers in urban cities as is indicated by the standard deviation (Fig. 4).

  - **Percentage of total fares per city type:** Urban cities had the highest percentage of total fares (62.7%), followed by suburban cities (30.5%), and rural cities (6.8%) (Fig. 5).

  - **Percentage of rides per city type:**  Urban cities had the highest percentage of total rides (68.4%), followed by suburban cities (26.3%), and rural cities (5.3%) (Fig. 6).
