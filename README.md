# PyBer Ride Share Analysis
## Overview
Data for 2019 were analyzed for PyBer, a ride sharing company, in order to determine the relationships between the type of city (urban, suburban, and rural) and the number of drivers and riders. The percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city was also calculated.  Findings were used to develop recommendations regarding access to ride share services for each city type and affordability of ride share services for underserved neighborhoods.
